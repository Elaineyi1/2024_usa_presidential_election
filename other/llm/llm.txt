Here's the completed code that reads the CSV file from the URL, saves it to a local file using the here package, and writes it back to a CSV:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(here)

# Read the CSV file from the URL
poll_raw <- read_csv(
  file = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv",
  show_col_types = FALSE
)

# Write the CSV file to a local directory using the 'here' package
write_csv(
  x = poll_raw,
  file = here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv")
)
This code uses here() to construct the correct file path for saving the file within your project structure. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

what package do I need to install if I want to use poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you want to use read.csv() along with here(), you do not need to install any additional packages beyond the base R installation and the here package.

Here’s what you need:

Base R: read.csv() is part of base R, so you don't need any additional package for this function.
here: You've already installed the here package, which helps construct file paths relative to your project directory.
If you have already done install.packages("here") and loaded it with library(here), you're good to go!

Your code would look like this:

r
Copy code
# Load the 'here' package
library(here)

# Use read.csv() with the file path from 'here'
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
This will correctly load the CSV using the path constructed by here().

give me the code in R using mutate that convert NA in state column to 'national', create another column called state_or_national that gives me state if state column is not NA and gives me national if state column is NA (basically the value in state column is either a state or NA, where NA means this is a national survey and state means this survey conducted in this state)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can use the mutate() function from the dplyr package to accomplish this. Here's the code to replace NA in the state column with "national" and create a new column called state_or_national based on whether the state column is NA or not.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Assuming 'poll_raw' is your dataframe
poll_raw <- poll_raw %>%
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "national", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "national", "national", state)
  )
Explanation:
mutate() is used to create or modify columns.
ifelse(is.na(state), "national", state) replaces NA in the state column with "national".
The second mutate() creates a new column state_or_national:
If the value in state is "national", it assigns "national".
Otherwise, it keeps the state name.
This code ensures that all NA values in the state column are converted to "national", and you get a new column that reflects whether it's a national or state-level survey.

To clean the state column, we can standardize the entries and handle specific cases like Congressional Districts (e.g., "Nebraska CD-2", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2"). Here's how we can do it:

Handle NA values: Replace NA values with "National".
Standardize state names: Make sure all state names are consistent.
Handle special cases: Congressional Districts like "Nebraska CD-2" should either remain as they are or be split into separate columns if needed.
Here’s a potential cleaning process in R using dplyr and stringr:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Clean the state column
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    # Replace NA values with "National"
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    
    # Handle specific cases (like Congressional Districts)
    state = str_replace_all(state, " CD-1", " Congressional District 1"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, " CD-2", " Congressional District 2"),
    
    # Standardize by trimming any excess whitespace
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state): Replaces NA values with "National".
str_replace_all(): Replaces the "CD-1" and "CD-2" patterns with more descriptive names.
str_trim(): Ensures there are no extra spaces in the state column.
This will give you a cleaner state column. If you'd like to handle the congressional districts differently, you can customize how they are labeled or split into additional columns. Let me know if you need more adjustments!

Got it! Here's how you can clean the state column by converting entries like "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2" to "Maine" and "Nebraska CD-2" to "Nebraska":

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Clean the state column
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    # Replace NA values with "National"
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    
    # Remove any congressional district references (CD-1, CD-2)
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    
    # Standardize by trimming any excess whitespace
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state): Replaces NA values with "National".
str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""): Removes any congressional district reference (e.g., " CD-1", " CD-2"), leaving just the state name.
str_trim(): Trims any leading or trailing whitespace.
This will transform entries like "Maine CD-1" and "Nebraska CD-2" into "Maine" and "Nebraska", respectively.

can you test that the number of row with state being NA in poll_row is the same as the number of row with state being national in poll_cleaned. Also test that the number of "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2" "Maine" in raw data is the same as Maine in cleaned data, as well as "Nebraska CD-2" and "Nebraska" using testthat
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To test that the cleaned data matches the raw data in the way you’ve described, we can use the testthat package. Specifically, we’ll check:

The number of rows where state is NA in poll_raw is the same as the number of rows where state is "National" in poll_cleaned.
The sum of occurrences of "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2", and "Maine" in poll_raw is the same as the number of "Maine" in poll_cleaned.
The sum of occurrences of "Nebraska CD-2" and "Nebraska" in poll_raw is the same as the number of "Nebraska" in poll_cleaned.
Here’s the R code with testthat tests:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)

# Assuming poll_raw and poll_cleaned are your data frames
test_that("NA in poll_raw equals 'National' in poll_cleaned", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(is.na(poll_raw$state)), 
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
  )
})

test_that("Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
  )
})

test_that("Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
  )
})
Explanation:
The test_that() function defines individual tests.
sum(is.na(poll_raw$state)) counts rows with NA in the state column of poll_raw.
sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National") counts rows where the state is "National" in poll_cleaned.
sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")) counts occurrences of "Maine" and its congressional districts in poll_raw.
Similarly, for "Nebraska" and "Nebraska CD-2", it checks if the combined count from poll_raw equals the "Nebraska" count in poll_cleaned.
These tests will validate whether the cleaned data transformations align with the raw data.

which package do I need to install Error in drop_na(select(clean_names(poll_raw), poll_id, pollster_id, pollster,  : 
  could not find function "drop_na"
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error you're seeing is because the drop_na() function comes from the tidyr package, not base R.

To resolve the issue, you need to install and load the tidyr package:

Installation:
r
Copy code
install.packages("tidyr")
Loading the package:
r
Copy code
library(tidyr)
Once tidyr is installed and loaded, you should be able to use the drop_na() function without errors.

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_raw %>%
  select(poll_id, pollster_id, pollster) %>%
  drop_na()
This will work as expected after loading tidyr. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

The error you're seeing is because the clean_names() function comes from the janitor package, which is not part of base R. You'll need to install and load the janitor package to use clean_names().

Installation:
r
Copy code
install.packages("janitor")
Loading the package:
r
Copy code
library(janitor)
Once you've installed and loaded janitor, the clean_names() function will work, and your code will run without errors:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(poll_id, pollster_id, pollster) %>%
  drop_na()
This will allow you to clean column names and proceed with your data transformation.

}) gives me 'code run outside of test_that()' in my R script
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error "code run outside of test_that()" typically happens when the testthat functions are used in contexts that aren't meant for unit testing (e.g., outside of test files or in environments where test_that isn't designed to handle code execution directly).

Here’s how you can resolve it:

Ensure you are running your tests in the correct context. Normally, testthat is used in a dedicated test file within the tests/testthat/ folder of an R package or project. If you are running the code in a script interactively (outside of a test framework), it might not work as expected.
If you're not working in a package environment, and you simply want to test your script in an R script file, try moving the code out of test_that() and run the checks directly. Alternatively, run the script in an interactive way by putting test functions in source() or using devtools::test() if in a package.
Here’s how to modify your script for running in a standard R script environment:

r
Copy code
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Testing logic outside of 'test_that()' for interactive script usage
# NA in raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
print(expect_equal(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
))

# Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
print(expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
))

# Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
print(expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
))
Key Changes:
Removed the test_that() wrapper for interactive testing. Now, the checks are simply executed directly with expect_equal().
Added print() around the test results so that they are visible in the R console when run in an interactive environment.
If you are developing a package or wish to keep using test_that(), consider placing the tests in a tests/testthat/ folder or run it with devtools::test() within a package context.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!






You said:
it gives me object 'poll_raw_for_test' not found
Backtrace: if I only contain test_that
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error 'poll_raw_for_test' not found happens because poll_raw_for_test isn't created or referenced properly inside the test_that() block. When using test_that(), make sure all necessary variables are defined inside or are accessible from within the test block.

To resolve this, define poll_raw_for_test before the test_that() block, ensuring it's available for the tests.

Here’s how you can structure your code with test_that() while ensuring the objects are properly defined:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw before testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Now the test_that blocks
test_that("NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
  )
})

test_that("Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
  )
})

test_that("Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
  )
})
Explanation:
The object poll_raw_for_test is now created before the test_that() blocks, making it available for testing.
All necessary data and preprocessing steps (like clean_names() and drop_na()) are handled before the tests.
Now, when you run the script, poll_raw_for_test will be available inside the test_that() blocks, and you should no longer see the "object not found" error.






You said:
code run outside of testthat
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The "code run outside of test_that()" error is a typical warning when test_that() blocks are executed in environments where they are not meant to be run, such as in an interactive R script. test_that() is specifically designed for use in test files (like those inside tests/testthat/ in an R package or project).

If you want to use test_that() in a standard script, you can ignore that warning as long as you don't expect the code to be run in a dedicated testing environment. However, to avoid that warning, you should either:

Use it in a test file: If you are building an R package, move your tests into the tests/testthat/ folder.
Run the code interactively: To bypass the test_that() framework for interactive testing, remove the test_that() blocks and directly run the expect_equal() tests as follows.
Here’s how you can rewrite the tests for interactive use without the test_that() framework:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)
library(testthat)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw for testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Test 1: NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
expect_equal(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
)

# Test 2: Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
)

# Test 3: Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
)
Key Changes:
Removed the test_that() wrapper.
Kept the expect_equal() functions directly to check your test cases in an interactive environment without triggering the test_that() warnings.
This will allow you to check your tests in an interactive R session without seeing the "code run outside of testthat()" warning.






You said:
can you use stop if not
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Sure! To use stopifnot() instead of test_that(), we simply replace the expect_equal() assertions with stopifnot(). If any of the conditions fail, stopifnot() will throw an error and stop the execution of the script.

Here’s how you can rewrite your tests with stopifnot() for interactive use:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw for testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Test 1: NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
stopifnot(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
)

# Test 2: Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
stopifnot(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
)

# Test 3: Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
stopifnot(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
)

# If all tests pass, the script continues. If any test fails, an error message will be displayed.
Explanation:
stopifnot() checks if the condition provided is TRUE. If not, it stops execution and throws an error.
The tests check if the number of NAs in the raw data corresponds to "National" in the cleaned data and if the counts for "Maine" and "Nebraska" match as expected.
If everything is correct, the script will run without errors. If any of the conditions are false, the script will stop, and you’ll see an error indicating which check failed.

what does state = str_trim(state) mean
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The code state = str_trim(state) is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the values in the state column of a data frame. This is especially useful when the data might contain extra spaces before or after the state names, which can lead to issues in data cleaning and comparison.

Here's a breakdown:
state: Refers to the state column of your data frame.
str_trim(): A function from the stringr package that removes leading (spaces before the text) and trailing (spaces after the text) whitespace from strings.
Example:
If your state column has a value like " California " (with extra spaces), str_trim(state) will convert it to "California" by removing the extra spaces.

Full code example:
r
Copy code
library(stringr)

# Example of trimming spaces in a 'state' column
data <- data.frame(state = c(" California ", " New York", "Texas "))

# Trim the leading and trailing spaces
data$state <- str_trim(data$state)

print(data)
This ensures all state names are cleaned of extra spaces, which helps in data analysis and prevents potential mismatches.






You said:
Do I need to change national to National? poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "national", "national", state),
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    state = str_trim(state))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Yes, you should change "national" to "National" for consistency if you're using "National" in other parts of your dataset. In your mutate() call, you are assigning "National" when state is NA, but in the state_or_national column, you're checking for "national" in lowercase.

To fix this, modify your mutate() to make sure both the state and state_or_national columns are consistent with "National" (capitalized). Here’s how you can adjust the code:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "National", "National", state),
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
state: Converts NA values to "National".
state_or_national: Checks if state is "National" (capitalized) and assigns "National" if true; otherwise, it keeps the state value.
state = str_replace(): Removes any congressional district suffixes (e.g., "Maine CD-1" becomes "Maine").
state = str_trim(): Removes any leading or trailing spaces in the state column.
This ensures consistent capitalization and correct handling of state names and national polls.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
It looks like you have a lot of unique dates in the end_date column of your dataset! If you're looking to perform any operations or analyses based on these dates, what do you have in mind? For example, do you need to convert these date strings into a date format, filter for specific dates, or summarize the data by date? Let me know how I can assist!






You said:
The dataset includes all the surveys and is updated frequently. To make my analysis reproducible and more accurate, I want to see Sys.Date() to filter survey ended within a month
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can use the Sys.Date() function in R to filter surveys that ended within the last month. Here’s how you can do that:

Ensure your dataset has a column that indicates when each survey ended (let’s call it end_date).
Use the following code to filter your dataset:
r
Copy code
# Assuming your dataset is called 'surveys' and the end date column is 'end_date'

# Convert the end_date column to Date type if it's not already
surveys$end_date <- as.Date(surveys$end_date)

# Get the current date
current_date <- Sys.Date()

# Filter for surveys that ended within the last month
recent_surveys <- surveys[surveys$end_date >= (current_date - 30), ]

# View the filtered dataset
print(recent_surveys)
This code will create a new data frame called recent_surveys containing only the surveys that ended in the last 30 days. Make sure to replace surveys and end_date with the actual names used in your dataset.






You said:
why this is wrong: poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = as.Date(end_date))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The code snippet you provided for cleaning the poll_cleaned dataset using the mutate() function looks mostly correct, but here are a few potential issues that could cause problems:

Column Existence: Ensure that the columns pct and end_date actually exist in your poll_cleaned dataset. If they don't, mutate() will fail.
Data Type Issues: If the pct column contains non-numeric values or if the end_date column has date formats that can't be parsed, converting them to numeric and Date types will result in NA values.
Package Loading: Ensure you have loaded the necessary libraries, especially dplyr, which is required for the mutate() function.
Here’s a revised approach to handle potential issues:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(as.character(pct)),  # Ensure pct is converted properly
    end_date = as.Date(end_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")  # Specify date format if necessary
  )
Additional Suggestions:
Check for NAs: After running the code, check if there are any NA values in pct or end_date:
r
Copy code
summary(poll_cleaned$pct)
summary(poll_cleaned$end_date)
Format for Dates: If end_date is in a format other than YYYY-MM-DD, adjust the format argument in as.Date() to match your data.
If you provide any error messages or additional context, I can help troubleshoot further!






You said:
Error in mutate():
ℹ In argument: end_date = mdy(end_date).
Caused by error in mdy():
! could not find function "mdy"
Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred.
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error indicates that the mdy() function is not recognized, which usually means the lubridate package is not loaded. The mdy() function is part of the lubridate library and is used to convert character representations of dates in "month-day-year" format to Date objects.

Here’s how you can fix this:

Load the lubridate package: Ensure that you have the package installed and loaded in your R session.
r
Copy code
install.packages("lubridate")  # Run this if you haven't installed it yet
library(lubridate)
Use mdy() for date conversion: Update your mutate() function to include mdy() for converting the end_date:
r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(as.character(pct)),  # Ensure pct is converted properly
    end_date = mdy(end_date)  # Convert end_date to Date using mdy()
  )
Additional Tips:
Check the Date Format: Ensure that the end_date column is indeed in "month-day-year" format. If it is in a different format, you might need to use a different function from lubridate, such as dmy() for "day-month-year" or ymd() for "year-month-day".
Handle NA Values: After conversion, you can check for NA values in end_date to ensure all dates were converted correctly.
Let me know if you run into any more issues!






You said:
why this code poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)) gives me correct start date but all the end dates are NA now?
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If your start_date is being converted correctly while all the end_date values are NA, it likely means that the end_date values are not in the expected "month-day-year" format, which is what mdy() requires. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check the Format of end_date: Inspect the end_date column to see how the dates are formatted. You can use head() or unique() to examine the first few entries or all unique entries:
r
Copy code
head(poll_cleaned$end_date)
unique(poll_cleaned$end_date)
Identify Non-Date Values: If there are non-date strings or improperly formatted dates in the end_date column, mdy() will return NA for those entries. You can check for this with:
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned |> 
  filter(is.na(mdy(end_date)))
Use the Correct Function: If the end_date is in a different format (e.g., "day-month-year" or "year-month-day"), you need to use the corresponding function from the lubridate package:
Use dmy() for "day-month-year"
Use ymd() for "year-month-day"
For example:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = dmy(end_date)  # Adjust this based on the actual format
  )
Check for Leading/Trailing Spaces: Sometimes, dates may have leading or trailing spaces that prevent proper conversion. You can clean the end_date column using trimws():
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(trimws(end_date))  # Remove spaces before conversion
  )
Convert to Character First: If end_date is a factor, convert it to character first before applying mdy():
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(as.character(end_date))  # Convert factor to character
  )
By following these steps, you should be able to identify the issue and convert the end_date correctly. Let me know how it goes!

  mutate() I want to create a new column that ranges from 0 to 1 to show how recently the survey is ended
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To create a new column that shows how recently the survey has ended, ranging from 0 to 1, you can calculate the difference between the current date (Sys.Date()) and the end_date, then normalize this value. Here’s how you can do it:

First, compute the number of days since the survey ended.
Normalize this value based on the maximum number of days you want to consider (e.g., 60 days).
Here's the code that implements this:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_end = as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date),
    recency_score = 1 - (days_since_end / 60)  # Normalize the score to be between 0 and 1
  ) |> 
  mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score))  # Ensure scores do not drop below 0
Explanation:
days_since_end: This calculates how many days ago the survey ended by subtracting end_date from Sys.Date().
recency_score: This normalizes the score based on a maximum range of 60 days. If the survey ended today, recency_score will be 1; if it ended 60 days ago, it will be 0.
ifelse(...): This ensures that if the score drops below 0 (which can happen if the end_date is more than 60 days ago), it will be set to 0.
Feel free to adjust the normalization range if you want to consider a different timeframe! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.






You said:
do I need mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score))  if I already use end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you're already filtering the data with filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)), the recency_score should theoretically never be less than 0 because you're only keeping surveys that ended within the last 60 days. Therefore, the additional mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score)) is not strictly necessary.

Your final code could look like this:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_end = as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date),
    recency_score = 1 - (days_since_end / 60)  # Normalize the score to be between 0 and 1
  )
With this code, recency_score will be between 0 and 1 for surveys that ended in the last 60 days, and you can safely omit the ifelse() statement.

If you later decide to adjust the filtering or the time frame, you might want to re-evaluate whether you need that additional safeguard. But for your current logic, it's not needed!






You said:
can I just use mutate(
    days_since_score = 1-(as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date))/60)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Yes, you can definitely simplify your code by using the mutate() function directly for calculating days_since_score! Your line of code:

r
Copy code
mutate(
    days_since_score = 1 - (as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date) / 60)
)
works perfectly. This will give you a days_since_score that ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents surveys that ended today and values approaching 0 represent surveys that ended further in the past (up to 60 days ago).

Here’s how it fits into your overall code:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_score = 1 - (as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date) / 60)  # Score from 0 to 1
  )
This keeps your analysis clear and concise!






You said:
is there a better name for days_since_score, I want to highlight days
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you want to highlight the concept of days in the score, here are a few suggestions for a better name:

days_recent_score
days_since_end_score
recency_days_score
recent_days_score
days_till_now_score
Each of these options emphasizes the number of days since the survey ended. Choose one that best fits the context of your analysis!

sum_pct_trump_harris <- poll_cleaned |> 
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  summarise(total_pct = sum(pct, na.rm = TRUE))

sum_pct_trump_harris
This code filters the dataset for the specified candidate names and then uses summarise() to calculate the sum of the pct column, ignoring any NA values with na.rm = TRUE. The result will be stored in the sum_pct_trump_harris variable.

ordered_pct_trump_harris <- poll_cleaned |> 
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  arrange(desc(pct))

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To create a new column that represents the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of the combined support for both her and Donald Trump, you can follow these steps:

Filter the dataset for only those rows where the candidate is either Trump or Harris.
Group the data by poll_id to calculate the total support for both candidates in each poll.
Calculate the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of her support to the total support for both candidates.
Create a new column in the original dataset to store these ratios.
Here’s how you can implement this in R:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  # Filter for candidates Trump and Harris
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  # Group by poll_id and calculate total support for Trump and Harris
  group_by(poll_id) |> 
  mutate(total_pct = sum(pct)) |> 
  # Calculate the support ratio for Kamala Harris
  mutate(harris_support_ratio = pct / total_pct) |> 
  # Un-group to return to original structure
  ungroup()

# Display the updated data frame
poll_cleaned
This code adds a new column harris_support_ratio that ranges from 0 to 1, showing the support for Kamala Harris relative to the total support for both candidates within each poll.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Got it! You want to calculate the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of her support to the total support for both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for each unique combination of poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, and end_date.

Here’s how you can do that in R using dplyr:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  # Filter for candidates Trump and Harris
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  # Group by relevant columns
  group_by(poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, end_date) |> 
  # Calculate total pct and pct for Harris
  mutate(
    total_pct = sum(pct),          # Total pct for both Trump and Harris
    harris_pct = sum(pct[candidate_name == "Kamala Harris"])  # Pct for Harris
  ) |> 
  # Calculate the support ratio for Kamala Harris
  mutate(harris_support_ratio = harris_pct / total_pct) |> 
  # Un-group to return to original structure
  ungroup() |> 
  # Optionally, drop the temporary columns if you don't need them
  select(-total_pct, -harris_pct)

# Display the updated data frame
poll_cleaned
Explanation:
Filtering: First, we filter the data to include only Trump and Harris.
Grouping: We group by the specified columns to ensure calculations are done within each group.
Calculating Totals: We calculate the total percentage (total_pct) and the percentage for Kamala Harris (harris_pct) within each group.
Calculating the Ratio: We compute the harris_support_ratio by dividing Harris's support by the total support.
Ungrouping: Finally, we ungroup the data and optionally remove the temporary columns (total_pct, harris_pct) if they are not needed.
This results in a new column that represents the support for Kamala Harris as a fraction of the total support for both her and Donald Trump for each unique poll.

use stopifnot to test the number of rows is correct for my codes: poll_national_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national == 'National')
poll_state_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national != 'National')
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To test that the number of rows is correct after filtering your data frames using stopifnot, you can compare the number of rows in the original poll_cleaned dataset with the sum of the rows in poll_national_cleaned and poll_state_cleaned. Here’s how you can do it:

r
Copy code
# Original number of rows
original_row_count <- nrow(poll_cleaned)

# Filtered datasets
poll_national_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national == 'National')
poll_state_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national != 'National')

# Check that the sum of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count
stopifnot(nrow(poll_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_state_cleaned) == original_row_count)

# Optionally, print a message if the test passes
cat("Test passed: The total number of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count.\n")
Explanation:
Original Row Count: We first store the original number of rows in poll_cleaned.
Filtering: We create the filtered data frames, poll_national_cleaned and poll_state_cleaned.
Testing: We use stopifnot to assert that the sum of the row counts from the two filtered data frames matches the original row count. If this condition is not met, an error will be thrown.
Message: If the condition is true, a message will be printed confirming that the test passed.
This will help ensure that your filtering operations are functioning as intended!

Here are some suggestions for using stopifnot to validate your code. These checks can help ensure that your data meets certain conditions after processing:

r
Copy code
# Check if harris_support_ratio is between 0 and 1
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio >= 0 & poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio <= 1))

# Check that the number of rows for national and state datasets matches the original cleaned dataset
stopifnot(nrow(poll_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_state_cleaned) == nrow(poll_cleaned))

# Check if there are any missing values in essential columns in the final datasets
stopifnot(!any(is.na(poll_national_cleaned$candidate_name)))
stopifnot(!any(is.na(poll_state_cleaned$candidate_name)))

# Check that the sum of pct for Harris and Trump does not exceed 100 for any group
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned %>%
              group_by(poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, end_date) %>%
              summarise(total_pct = sum(pct)) %>%
              pull(total_pct) <= 100))

# Check that the cleaned dataset does not contain any rows for candidates other than Trump and Harris
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")))

# Check that there are no negative pct values in the cleaned dataset
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$pct >= 0))
These assertions will help ensure the integrity of your dataset as you process it. Adjust any messages or conditions based on your specific needs!

You can add the following stopifnot checks to ensure that the end_date is not larger than Sys.Date() - 60 and that days_since_end is between 0 and 1:

r
Copy code
# Check that end_date is not larger than Sys.Date() - 60
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$end_date <= (Sys.Date() - 60)))

# Check that days_since_end is between 0 and 1
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$days_since_end >= 0 & poll_cleaned$days_since_end <= 1))
These checks will help confirm that the end_date is correctly filtered and that the days_since_end values fall within the expected range. If any of these conditions are not met, R will throw an error, indicating where the issue may lie.

for poll_harris_cleaned dataset, can you eliminate those state == 'National', group it by state, and for each state find the average harris_support_ratio
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can eliminate the rows where state is equal to 'National', group the dataset by state, and then calculate the average harris_support_ratio for each state using the following code:

r
Copy code
poll_harris_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>         # Eliminate rows where state is 'National'
  group_by(state) |>                      # Group by state
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  # Calculate average
  ungroup()                               # Ungroup the data frame
In this code:

filter(state != 'National') removes rows with state equal to 'National'.
group_by(state) groups the remaining data by state.
summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) calculates the average harris_support_ratio for each state, using na.rm = TRUE to ignore any NA values.
ungroup() is used to return the dataset to its ungrouped state after the summary.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To fill the states not included in your poll_harris_cleaned dataset with grey, you can first create a complete map of all states and then join it with your average values. This way, states not included in poll_harris_cleaned will default to a grey fill.

Here's how you can do it:

Use a dataset of U.S. states with their geometries.
Join your summarized data with this dataset.
Adjust the fill aesthetic to handle missing values.
Here’s an example code snippet using maps and dplyr for the state map:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(ggstatebins)

# Load state map data
state_map <- map_data("state")

# Prepare the poll_harris_cleaned dataset
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()

# Join the state map with the summary data
state_map <- state_map |>
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Create the plot
ggplot(state_map, aes(map_id = region)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = ifelse(is.na(average_harris_support_ratio), "grey", average_harris_support_ratio)), map = state_map) +
  expand_limits(x = state_map$long, y = state_map$lat) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Adjustments:
Joining the State Map: The left_join ensures all states are included in the plot, and missing values from poll_harris_cleaned_summary will default to NA.
Fill Handling: The ifelse(is.na(...), "grey", ...) function allows for grey fill in states without data.
Using na.value: The na.value = "grey" argument in scale_fill_gradient2 ensures that any missing average values will also be displayed in grey.
This code assumes you have the necessary libraries (ggplot2, dplyr, and maps) installed and loaded. Adjust the dataset join key if your state names are formatted differently.






You said:
can you modify the code I just sent you? This is a little bit complicated
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Sure! Let’s simplify the process while keeping your existing code structure. You can modify your original code to include grey for states not in the dataset like this:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Summarize the data by state, excluding 'National'
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ungroup()

# Create a full list of states to fill in grey for missing states
all_states <- data.frame(state = state.abb)  # Assuming you want to use state abbreviations

# Join the summary with all states to include missing states
state_summary <- all_states |> 
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = "state")

# Create the map plot
ggplot(state_summary, aes(map_id = state)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = ifelse(is.na(average_harris_support_ratio), "grey", average_harris_support_ratio)), map = state_map) +
  expand_limits(x = state_map$long, y = state_map$lat) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Changes:
Full List of States: Added a data frame all_states to include all state abbreviations. You might need to adjust it if your states are in a different format.
Left Join: The left_join with poll_harris_cleaned_summary ensures that all states are represented.
Fill Logic: The ifelse(is.na(...), "grey", ...) logic remains to fill states not in the dataset with grey.
This should work to display all states while highlighting those with data in the gradient specified, and grey for those without data.

It looks like you’re running into a couple of issues: a warning about non-finite values and an error indicating that state_map is not found. Let's address both of these.

1. Warning: Removed Rows
The warning message you see (Removed 1869 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range) suggests that there are NA or non-finite values in your average_harris_support_ratio column. To handle this, you can ensure you are using na.rm = TRUE in your calculations, which you have already included. If some states are not present in the poll_harris_cleaned dataset, they will have NA values, which is what you are intending to fill with grey.

2. Error: state_map Not Found
The error about state_map not being found indicates that the object state_map (which should contain the map data for the states) hasn’t been defined in your code. You will need to load or define this object before running the plotting code. A common way to get state boundaries is to use the maps package or the map_data() function from ggplot2. Here’s how you can do that:

Complete Example Code
Here's how to revise your code to ensure it works correctly:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)

# Summarize the data by state, excluding 'National'
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ungroup()

# Create a full list of states to fill in grey for missing states
all_states <- data.frame(state = state.abb)  # Assuming you want to use state abbreviations

# Join the summary with all states to include missing states
state_summary <- all_states |> 
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = "state")

# Get state map data
state_map <- map_data("state")

# Create the map plot
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = state_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_polygon(data = state_summary, aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = average_harris_support_ratio), 
               color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Changes:
Loading Map Data: The state_map is obtained using map_data("state"). This gives the necessary coordinates for plotting the states.
Polygon Layers: Use geom_polygon() to plot both the state boundaries and the fill colors based on your calculated ratios.
Debugging Steps
If the warnings about removed rows persist, check the poll_harris_cleaned_summary to confirm that it contains the expected data.
If you encounter further issues, make sure that the poll_harris_cleaned dataset is correctly populated before summarizing.
This approach should resolve the errors you're facing and provide the desired visualization with missing states filled in grey.

what does statistic = "mad" mean
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
In statistics, MAD stands for Median Absolute Deviation. It is a robust measure of variability or dispersion, particularly useful when data contains outliers. Here's how it works:

Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is calculated as the median of the absolute deviations from the data's median:
MAD
=
median
(
∣
X
i
−
median
(
X
)
∣
)
MAD=median(∣X 
i
​	
 −median(X)∣)
where 
X
i
X 
i
​	
  are the data points.
Using statistic = "mad" typically indicates that the MAD is being computed or plotted instead of the more common standard deviation. This is often preferred when the data is non-normally distributed or contains significant outliers, as MAD is less sensitive to extreme values than standard deviation.

Boxplot comparing the numeric grades of national and state surveys. The x-axis categorizes surveys as either national or state, while the y-axis represents the numeric grade assigned to each survey, ranging from 0 to 3 in 0.5 increments. The figure shows the distribution of numeric grades across the two categories, illustrating the central tendency and variability of grades for both national and state-level polls. This provides insight into whether survey quality differs depending on the scope of the survey (national vs. state).

Your code looks good for calculating the weighted average of Harris support by state. If you're looking for a title for the table or want any specific adjustments, let me know! Here's a suggestion for a title:

Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support by State

is it okay? Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support Based On National Survey
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
That title works well! It clearly indicates that the values represent the weighted average proportion of Harris support derived from national surveys. If you want to emphasize the dataset further, you might consider adding "in the Dataset" or "in the Analysis" at the end, but it's not necessary. Your original title is clear and informative!

is there any mistake in my title
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your title is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, for clarity and flow, you might consider rephrasing it slightly. Here are a couple of options:

"Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support from National Surveys"
"Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support Based on National Survey Data"
These alternatives maintain your original intent while enhancing readability. But your original title is still perfectly acceptable!






You said:
Proportion of Harris Support from State Surveys By State
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your title is clear, but it could be slightly refined for better flow. Here’s a revised suggestion:

"Proportion of Harris Support by State from State Surveys"

This wording emphasizes that the proportions are specific to each state and are derived from state surveys. If you prefer your version, it’s still understandable!

modelsummary(
  list("Support Harris" = harris_model),
  statistic = "mad"
  )
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your code is almost correct for using the modelsummary package to summarize your model, but it's missing the function call for modelsummary(). Here’s how it should look:

r
Copy code
modelsummary(
  list("Support Harris" = harris_model),
  statistic = "mad"
)
Just ensure you have the modelsummary package installed and loaded in your R environment. This command will display a summary of your harris_model with the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as the statistic.

give it a title given that: harris_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = harris_support_ratio ~ pollster + numeric_grade + days_since_end + population,  # Include national_poll as a predictor
  data = poll_harris_cleaned,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 7
)

A suitable title for your model summary could be:

"Bayesian Model of Harris Support Ratio: Effects of Pollster, Numeric Grade, Days Since End, and Population"

This title captures the key aspects of the model and the predictors involved.






You said:
a title for the summary table
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Here’s a concise title for the summary table:

"Summary of Bayesian Model Results for Harris Support Ratio"

This title clearly indicates that the table presents the results from the Bayesian model related to Harris support.
