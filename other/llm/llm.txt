Here's the completed code that reads the CSV file from the URL, saves it to a local file using the here package, and writes it back to a CSV:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
library(here)

# Read the CSV file from the URL
poll_raw <- read_csv(
  file = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/data/president_polls.csv",
  show_col_types = FALSE
)

# Write the CSV file to a local directory using the 'here' package
write_csv(
  x = poll_raw,
  file = here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv")
)
This code uses here() to construct the correct file path for saving the file within your project structure. Let me know if you'd like further adjustments!

what package do I need to install if I want to use poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you want to use read.csv() along with here(), you do not need to install any additional packages beyond the base R installation and the here package.

Here’s what you need:

Base R: read.csv() is part of base R, so you don't need any additional package for this function.
here: You've already installed the here package, which helps construct file paths relative to your project directory.
If you have already done install.packages("here") and loaded it with library(here), you're good to go!

Your code would look like this:

r
Copy code
# Load the 'here' package
library(here)

# Use read.csv() with the file path from 'here'
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
This will correctly load the CSV using the path constructed by here().






You said:
give me the code in R using mutate that convert NA in state column to 'national', create another column called state_or_national that gives me state if state column is not NA and gives me national if state column is NA (basically the value in state column is either a state or NA, where NA means this is a national survey and state means this survey conducted in this state)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can use the mutate() function from the dplyr package to accomplish this. Here's the code to replace NA in the state column with "national" and create a new column called state_or_national based on whether the state column is NA or not.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Assuming 'poll_raw' is your dataframe
poll_raw <- poll_raw %>%
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "national", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "national", "national", state)
  )
Explanation:
mutate() is used to create or modify columns.
ifelse(is.na(state), "national", state) replaces NA in the state column with "national".
The second mutate() creates a new column state_or_national:
If the value in state is "national", it assigns "national".
Otherwise, it keeps the state name.
This code ensures that all NA values in the state column are converted to "national", and you get a new column that reflects whether it's a national or state-level survey.

To clean the state column, we can standardize the entries and handle specific cases like Congressional Districts (e.g., "Nebraska CD-2", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2"). Here's how we can do it:

Handle NA values: Replace NA values with "National".
Standardize state names: Make sure all state names are consistent.
Handle special cases: Congressional Districts like "Nebraska CD-2" should either remain as they are or be split into separate columns if needed.
Here’s a potential cleaning process in R using dplyr and stringr:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Clean the state column
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    # Replace NA values with "National"
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    
    # Handle specific cases (like Congressional Districts)
    state = str_replace_all(state, " CD-1", " Congressional District 1"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, " CD-2", " Congressional District 2"),
    
    # Standardize by trimming any excess whitespace
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state): Replaces NA values with "National".
str_replace_all(): Replaces the "CD-1" and "CD-2" patterns with more descriptive names.
str_trim(): Ensures there are no extra spaces in the state column.
This will give you a cleaner state column. If you'd like to handle the congressional districts differently, you can customize how they are labeled or split into additional columns. Let me know if you need more adjustments!

Got it! Here's how you can clean the state column by converting entries like "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2" to "Maine" and "Nebraska CD-2" to "Nebraska":

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Clean the state column
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    # Replace NA values with "National"
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    
    # Remove any congressional district references (CD-1, CD-2)
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    
    # Standardize by trimming any excess whitespace
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state): Replaces NA values with "National".
str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""): Removes any congressional district reference (e.g., " CD-1", " CD-2"), leaving just the state name.
str_trim(): Trims any leading or trailing whitespace.
This will transform entries like "Maine CD-1" and "Nebraska CD-2" into "Maine" and "Nebraska", respectively.

can you test that the number of row with state being NA in poll_row is the same as the number of row with state being national in poll_cleaned. Also test that the number of "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2" "Maine" in raw data is the same as Maine in cleaned data, as well as "Nebraska CD-2" and "Nebraska" using testthat
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To test that the cleaned data matches the raw data in the way you’ve described, we can use the testthat package. Specifically, we’ll check:

The number of rows where state is NA in poll_raw is the same as the number of rows where state is "National" in poll_cleaned.
The sum of occurrences of "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2", and "Maine" in poll_raw is the same as the number of "Maine" in poll_cleaned.
The sum of occurrences of "Nebraska CD-2" and "Nebraska" in poll_raw is the same as the number of "Nebraska" in poll_cleaned.
Here’s the R code with testthat tests:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)

# Assuming poll_raw and poll_cleaned are your data frames
test_that("NA in poll_raw equals 'National' in poll_cleaned", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(is.na(poll_raw$state)), 
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
  )
})

test_that("Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
  )
})

test_that("Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
  )
})
Explanation:
The test_that() function defines individual tests.
sum(is.na(poll_raw$state)) counts rows with NA in the state column of poll_raw.
sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National") counts rows where the state is "National" in poll_cleaned.
sum(poll_raw$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")) counts occurrences of "Maine" and its congressional districts in poll_raw.
Similarly, for "Nebraska" and "Nebraska CD-2", it checks if the combined count from poll_raw equals the "Nebraska" count in poll_cleaned.
These tests will validate whether the cleaned data transformations align with the raw data.

which package do I need to install Error in drop_na(select(clean_names(poll_raw), poll_id, pollster_id, pollster,  : 
  could not find function "drop_na"
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error you're seeing is because the drop_na() function comes from the tidyr package, not base R.

To resolve the issue, you need to install and load the tidyr package:

Installation:
r
Copy code
install.packages("tidyr")
Loading the package:
r
Copy code
library(tidyr)
Once tidyr is installed and loaded, you should be able to use the drop_na() function without errors.

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_raw %>%
  select(poll_id, pollster_id, pollster) %>%
  drop_na()
This will work as expected after loading tidyr. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

Error in clean_names(poll_raw) : could not find function "clean_names"
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error you're seeing is because the clean_names() function comes from the janitor package, which is not part of base R. You'll need to install and load the janitor package to use clean_names().

Installation:
r
Copy code
install.packages("janitor")
Loading the package:
r
Copy code
library(janitor)
Once you've installed and loaded janitor, the clean_names() function will work, and your code will run without errors:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(poll_id, pollster_id, pollster) %>%
  drop_na()
This will allow you to clean column names and proceed with your data transformation.

}) gives me 'code run outside of test_that()' in my R script
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error "code run outside of test_that()" typically happens when the testthat functions are used in contexts that aren't meant for unit testing (e.g., outside of test files or in environments where test_that isn't designed to handle code execution directly).

Here’s how you can resolve it:

Ensure you are running your tests in the correct context. Normally, testthat is used in a dedicated test file within the tests/testthat/ folder of an R package or project. If you are running the code in a script interactively (outside of a test framework), it might not work as expected.
If you're not working in a package environment, and you simply want to test your script in an R script file, try moving the code out of test_that() and run the checks directly. Alternatively, run the script in an interactive way by putting test functions in source() or using devtools::test() if in a package.
Here’s how to modify your script for running in a standard R script environment:

r
Copy code
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Testing logic outside of 'test_that()' for interactive script usage
# NA in raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
print(expect_equal(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
))

# Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
print(expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
))

# Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
print(expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
))
Key Changes:
Removed the test_that() wrapper for interactive testing. Now, the checks are simply executed directly with expect_equal().
Added print() around the test results so that they are visible in the R console when run in an interactive environment.
If you are developing a package or wish to keep using test_that(), consider placing the tests in a tests/testthat/ folder or run it with devtools::test() within a package context.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!






You said:
it gives me object 'poll_raw_for_test' not found
Backtrace: if I only contain test_that
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error 'poll_raw_for_test' not found happens because poll_raw_for_test isn't created or referenced properly inside the test_that() block. When using test_that(), make sure all necessary variables are defined inside or are accessible from within the test block.

To resolve this, define poll_raw_for_test before the test_that() block, ensuring it's available for the tests.

Here’s how you can structure your code with test_that() while ensuring the objects are properly defined:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(testthat)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw before testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Now the test_that blocks
test_that("NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
  )
})

test_that("Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
  )
})

test_that("Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(
    sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
    sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
  )
})
Explanation:
The object poll_raw_for_test is now created before the test_that() blocks, making it available for testing.
All necessary data and preprocessing steps (like clean_names() and drop_na()) are handled before the tests.
Now, when you run the script, poll_raw_for_test will be available inside the test_that() blocks, and you should no longer see the "object not found" error.






You said:
code run outside of testthat
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The "code run outside of test_that()" error is a typical warning when test_that() blocks are executed in environments where they are not meant to be run, such as in an interactive R script. test_that() is specifically designed for use in test files (like those inside tests/testthat/ in an R package or project).

If you want to use test_that() in a standard script, you can ignore that warning as long as you don't expect the code to be run in a dedicated testing environment. However, to avoid that warning, you should either:

Use it in a test file: If you are building an R package, move your tests into the tests/testthat/ folder.
Run the code interactively: To bypass the test_that() framework for interactive testing, remove the test_that() blocks and directly run the expect_equal() tests as follows.
Here’s how you can rewrite the tests for interactive use without the test_that() framework:
r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)
library(testthat)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw for testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Test 1: NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
expect_equal(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)), 
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
)

# Test 2: Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
)

# Test 3: Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
expect_equal(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")),
  sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
)
Key Changes:
Removed the test_that() wrapper.
Kept the expect_equal() functions directly to check your test cases in an interactive environment without triggering the test_that() warnings.
This will allow you to check your tests in an interactive R session without seeing the "code run outside of testthat()" warning.






You said:
can you use stop if not
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Sure! To use stopifnot() instead of test_that(), we simply replace the expect_equal() assertions with stopifnot(). If any of the conditions fail, stopifnot() will throw an error and stop the execution of the script.

Here’s how you can rewrite your tests with stopifnot() for interactive use:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(here)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.csv"))

# Preprocess poll_raw for testing
poll_raw_for_test <- poll_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(numeric_grade)

# Test 1: NA in the raw data equals 'National' in the cleaned dataset
stopifnot(
  sum(is.na(poll_raw_for_test$state)) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "National")
)

# Test 2: Maine counts match between raw and cleaned data
stopifnot(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Maine", "Maine CD-1", "Maine CD-2")) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Maine")
)

# Test 3: Nebraska counts match between raw and cleaned data
stopifnot(
  sum(poll_raw_for_test$state %in% c("Nebraska", "Nebraska CD-2")) == sum(poll_cleaned$state == "Nebraska")
)

# If all tests pass, the script continues. If any test fails, an error message will be displayed.
Explanation:
stopifnot() checks if the condition provided is TRUE. If not, it stops execution and throws an error.
The tests check if the number of NAs in the raw data corresponds to "National" in the cleaned data and if the counts for "Maine" and "Nebraska" match as expected.
If everything is correct, the script will run without errors. If any of the conditions are false, the script will stop, and you’ll see an error indicating which check failed.

what does state = str_trim(state) mean
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The code state = str_trim(state) is used to remove any leading and trailing whitespace from the values in the state column of a data frame. This is especially useful when the data might contain extra spaces before or after the state names, which can lead to issues in data cleaning and comparison.

Here's a breakdown:
state: Refers to the state column of your data frame.
str_trim(): A function from the stringr package that removes leading (spaces before the text) and trailing (spaces after the text) whitespace from strings.
Example:
If your state column has a value like " California " (with extra spaces), str_trim(state) will convert it to "California" by removing the extra spaces.

Full code example:
r
Copy code
library(stringr)

# Example of trimming spaces in a 'state' column
data <- data.frame(state = c(" California ", " New York", "Texas "))

# Trim the leading and trailing spaces
data$state <- str_trim(data$state)

print(data)
This ensures all state names are cleaned of extra spaces, which helps in data analysis and prevents potential mismatches.






You said:
Do I need to change national to National? poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "national", "national", state),
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    state = str_trim(state))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Yes, you should change "national" to "National" for consistency if you're using "National" in other parts of your dataset. In your mutate() call, you are assigning "National" when state is NA, but in the state_or_national column, you're checking for "national" in lowercase.

To fix this, modify your mutate() to make sure both the state and state_or_national columns are consistent with "National" (capitalized). Here’s how you can adjust the code:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  mutate(
    state = ifelse(is.na(state), "National", state),
    state_or_national = ifelse(state == "National", "National", state),
    state = str_replace(state, " CD-.*", ""),
    state = str_trim(state)
  )
Explanation:
state: Converts NA values to "National".
state_or_national: Checks if state is "National" (capitalized) and assigns "National" if true; otherwise, it keeps the state value.
state = str_replace(): Removes any congressional district suffixes (e.g., "Maine CD-1" becomes "Maine").
state = str_trim(): Removes any leading or trailing spaces in the state column.
This ensures consistent capitalization and correct handling of state names and national polls.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
It looks like you have a lot of unique dates in the end_date column of your dataset! If you're looking to perform any operations or analyses based on these dates, what do you have in mind? For example, do you need to convert these date strings into a date format, filter for specific dates, or summarize the data by date? Let me know how I can assist!






You said:
The dataset includes all the surveys and is updated frequently. To make my analysis reproducible and more accurate, I want to see Sys.Date() to filter survey ended within a month
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can use the Sys.Date() function in R to filter surveys that ended within the last month. Here’s how you can do that:

Ensure your dataset has a column that indicates when each survey ended (let’s call it end_date).
Use the following code to filter your dataset:
r
Copy code
# Assuming your dataset is called 'surveys' and the end date column is 'end_date'

# Convert the end_date column to Date type if it's not already
surveys$end_date <- as.Date(surveys$end_date)

# Get the current date
current_date <- Sys.Date()

# Filter for surveys that ended within the last month
recent_surveys <- surveys[surveys$end_date >= (current_date - 30), ]

# View the filtered dataset
print(recent_surveys)
This code will create a new data frame called recent_surveys containing only the surveys that ended in the last 30 days. Make sure to replace surveys and end_date with the actual names used in your dataset.






You said:
why this is wrong: poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = as.Date(end_date))
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The code snippet you provided for cleaning the poll_cleaned dataset using the mutate() function looks mostly correct, but here are a few potential issues that could cause problems:

Column Existence: Ensure that the columns pct and end_date actually exist in your poll_cleaned dataset. If they don't, mutate() will fail.
Data Type Issues: If the pct column contains non-numeric values or if the end_date column has date formats that can't be parsed, converting them to numeric and Date types will result in NA values.
Package Loading: Ensure you have loaded the necessary libraries, especially dplyr, which is required for the mutate() function.
Here’s a revised approach to handle potential issues:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(as.character(pct)),  # Ensure pct is converted properly
    end_date = as.Date(end_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")  # Specify date format if necessary
  )
Additional Suggestions:
Check for NAs: After running the code, check if there are any NA values in pct or end_date:
r
Copy code
summary(poll_cleaned$pct)
summary(poll_cleaned$end_date)
Format for Dates: If end_date is in a format other than YYYY-MM-DD, adjust the format argument in as.Date() to match your data.
If you provide any error messages or additional context, I can help troubleshoot further!






You said:
Error in mutate():
ℹ In argument: end_date = mdy(end_date).
Caused by error in mdy():
! could not find function "mdy"
Run rlang::last_trace() to see where the error occurred.
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The error indicates that the mdy() function is not recognized, which usually means the lubridate package is not loaded. The mdy() function is part of the lubridate library and is used to convert character representations of dates in "month-day-year" format to Date objects.

Here’s how you can fix this:

Load the lubridate package: Ensure that you have the package installed and loaded in your R session.
r
Copy code
install.packages("lubridate")  # Run this if you haven't installed it yet
library(lubridate)
Use mdy() for date conversion: Update your mutate() function to include mdy() for converting the end_date:
r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(as.character(pct)),  # Ensure pct is converted properly
    end_date = mdy(end_date)  # Convert end_date to Date using mdy()
  )
Additional Tips:
Check the Date Format: Ensure that the end_date column is indeed in "month-day-year" format. If it is in a different format, you might need to use a different function from lubridate, such as dmy() for "day-month-year" or ymd() for "year-month-day".
Handle NA Values: After conversion, you can check for NA values in end_date to ensure all dates were converted correctly.
Let me know if you run into any more issues!






You said:
why this code poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)) gives me correct start date but all the end dates are NA now?
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If your start_date is being converted correctly while all the end_date values are NA, it likely means that the end_date values are not in the expected "month-day-year" format, which is what mdy() requires. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check the Format of end_date: Inspect the end_date column to see how the dates are formatted. You can use head() or unique() to examine the first few entries or all unique entries:
r
Copy code
head(poll_cleaned$end_date)
unique(poll_cleaned$end_date)
Identify Non-Date Values: If there are non-date strings or improperly formatted dates in the end_date column, mdy() will return NA for those entries. You can check for this with:
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned |> 
  filter(is.na(mdy(end_date)))
Use the Correct Function: If the end_date is in a different format (e.g., "day-month-year" or "year-month-day"), you need to use the corresponding function from the lubridate package:
Use dmy() for "day-month-year"
Use ymd() for "year-month-day"
For example:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = dmy(end_date)  # Adjust this based on the actual format
  )
Check for Leading/Trailing Spaces: Sometimes, dates may have leading or trailing spaces that prevent proper conversion. You can clean the end_date column using trimws():
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(trimws(end_date))  # Remove spaces before conversion
  )
Convert to Character First: If end_date is a factor, convert it to character first before applying mdy():
r
Copy code
poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    start_date = mdy(start_date),
    end_date = mdy(as.character(end_date))  # Convert factor to character
  )
By following these steps, you should be able to identify the issue and convert the end_date correctly. Let me know how it goes!

  mutate() I want to create a new column that ranges from 0 to 1 to show how recently the survey is ended
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To create a new column that shows how recently the survey has ended, ranging from 0 to 1, you can calculate the difference between the current date (Sys.Date()) and the end_date, then normalize this value. Here’s how you can do it:

First, compute the number of days since the survey ended.
Normalize this value based on the maximum number of days you want to consider (e.g., 60 days).
Here's the code that implements this:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_end = as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date),
    recency_score = 1 - (days_since_end / 60)  # Normalize the score to be between 0 and 1
  ) |> 
  mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score))  # Ensure scores do not drop below 0
Explanation:
days_since_end: This calculates how many days ago the survey ended by subtracting end_date from Sys.Date().
recency_score: This normalizes the score based on a maximum range of 60 days. If the survey ended today, recency_score will be 1; if it ended 60 days ago, it will be 0.
ifelse(...): This ensures that if the score drops below 0 (which can happen if the end_date is more than 60 days ago), it will be set to 0.
Feel free to adjust the normalization range if you want to consider a different timeframe! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.






You said:
do I need mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score))  if I already use end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you're already filtering the data with filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)), the recency_score should theoretically never be less than 0 because you're only keeping surveys that ended within the last 60 days. Therefore, the additional mutate(recency_score = ifelse(recency_score < 0, 0, recency_score)) is not strictly necessary.

Your final code could look like this:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_end = as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date),
    recency_score = 1 - (days_since_end / 60)  # Normalize the score to be between 0 and 1
  )
With this code, recency_score will be between 0 and 1 for surveys that ended in the last 60 days, and you can safely omit the ifelse() statement.

If you later decide to adjust the filtering or the time frame, you might want to re-evaluate whether you need that additional safeguard. But for your current logic, it's not needed!






You said:
can I just use mutate(
    days_since_score = 1-(as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date))/60)
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Yes, you can definitely simplify your code by using the mutate() function directly for calculating days_since_score! Your line of code:

r
Copy code
mutate(
    days_since_score = 1 - (as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date) / 60)
)
works perfectly. This will give you a days_since_score that ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents surveys that ended today and values approaching 0 represent surveys that ended further in the past (up to 60 days ago).

Here’s how it fits into your overall code:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  mutate(
    pct = as.numeric(pct),
    end_date = mdy(end_date)
  ) |> 
  filter(end_date >= (Sys.Date() - 60)) |> 
  mutate(
    days_since_score = 1 - (as.numeric(Sys.Date() - end_date) / 60)  # Score from 0 to 1
  )
This keeps your analysis clear and concise!






You said:
is there a better name for days_since_score, I want to highlight days
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
If you want to highlight the concept of days in the score, here are a few suggestions for a better name:

days_recent_score
days_since_end_score
recency_days_score
recent_days_score
days_till_now_score
Each of these options emphasizes the number of days since the survey ended. Choose one that best fits the context of your analysis!

sum_pct_trump_harris <- poll_cleaned |> 
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  summarise(total_pct = sum(pct, na.rm = TRUE))

sum_pct_trump_harris
This code filters the dataset for the specified candidate names and then uses summarise() to calculate the sum of the pct column, ignoring any NA values with na.rm = TRUE. The result will be stored in the sum_pct_trump_harris variable.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To create a new column that represents the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of the combined support for both her and Donald Trump, you can follow these steps:

Filter the dataset for only those rows where the candidate is either Trump or Harris.
Group the data by poll_id to calculate the total support for both candidates in each poll.
Calculate the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of her support to the total support for both candidates.
Create a new column in the original dataset to store these ratios.
Here’s how you can implement this in R:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  # Filter for candidates Trump and Harris
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  # Group by poll_id and calculate total support for Trump and Harris
  group_by(poll_id) |> 
  mutate(total_pct = sum(pct)) |> 
  # Calculate the support ratio for Kamala Harris
  mutate(harris_support_ratio = pct / total_pct) |> 
  # Un-group to return to original structure
  ungroup()

# Display the updated data frame
poll_cleaned
This code adds a new column harris_support_ratio that ranges from 0 to 1, showing the support for Kamala Harris relative to the total support for both candidates within each poll.

ChatGPT said:

Got it! You want to calculate the support for Kamala Harris as a ratio of her support to the total support for both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for each unique combination of poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, and end_date.

Here’s how you can do that in R using dplyr:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

poll_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> 
  # Filter for candidates Trump and Harris
  filter(candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")) |> 
  # Group by relevant columns
  group_by(poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, end_date) |> 
  # Calculate total pct and pct for Harris
  mutate(
    total_pct = sum(pct),          # Total pct for both Trump and Harris
    harris_pct = sum(pct[candidate_name == "Kamala Harris"])  # Pct for Harris
  ) |> 
  # Calculate the support ratio for Kamala Harris
  mutate(harris_support_ratio = harris_pct / total_pct) |> 
  # Un-group to return to original structure
  ungroup() |> 
  # Optionally, drop the temporary columns if you don't need them
  select(-total_pct, -harris_pct)

# Display the updated data frame
poll_cleaned
Explanation:
Filtering: First, we filter the data to include only Trump and Harris.
Grouping: We group by the specified columns to ensure calculations are done within each group.
Calculating Totals: We calculate the total percentage (total_pct) and the percentage for Kamala Harris (harris_pct) within each group.
Calculating the Ratio: We compute the harris_support_ratio by dividing Harris's support by the total support.
Ungrouping: Finally, we ungroup the data and optionally remove the temporary columns (total_pct, harris_pct) if they are not needed.
This results in a new column that represents the support for Kamala Harris as a fraction of the total support for both her and Donald Trump for each unique poll.

use stopifnot to test the number of rows is correct for my codes: poll_national_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national == 'National')
poll_state_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national != 'National')
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To test that the number of rows is correct after filtering your data frames using stopifnot, you can compare the number of rows in the original poll_cleaned dataset with the sum of the rows in poll_national_cleaned and poll_state_cleaned. Here’s how you can do it:

r
Copy code
# Original number of rows
original_row_count <- nrow(poll_cleaned)

# Filtered datasets
poll_national_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national == 'National')
poll_state_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |> filter(state_or_national != 'National')

# Check that the sum of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count
stopifnot(nrow(poll_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_state_cleaned) == original_row_count)

# Optionally, print a message if the test passes
cat("Test passed: The total number of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count.\n")
Explanation:
Original Row Count: We first store the original number of rows in poll_cleaned.
Filtering: We create the filtered data frames, poll_national_cleaned and poll_state_cleaned.
Testing: We use stopifnot to assert that the sum of the row counts from the two filtered data frames matches the original row count. If this condition is not met, an error will be thrown.
Message: If the condition is true, a message will be printed confirming that the test passed.
This will help ensure that your filtering operations are functioning as intended!

Here are some suggestions for using stopifnot to validate your code. These checks can help ensure that your data meets certain conditions after processing:

r
Copy code
# Check if harris_support_ratio is between 0 and 1
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio >= 0 & poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio <= 1))

# Check that the number of rows for national and state datasets matches the original cleaned dataset
stopifnot(nrow(poll_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_state_cleaned) == nrow(poll_cleaned))

# Check if there are any missing values in essential columns in the final datasets
stopifnot(!any(is.na(poll_national_cleaned$candidate_name)))
stopifnot(!any(is.na(poll_state_cleaned$candidate_name)))

# Check that the sum of pct for Harris and Trump does not exceed 100 for any group
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned %>%
              group_by(poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, state, sample_size, start_date, end_date) %>%
              summarise(total_pct = sum(pct)) %>%
              pull(total_pct) <= 100))

# Check that the cleaned dataset does not contain any rows for candidates other than Trump and Harris
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")))

# Check that there are no negative pct values in the cleaned dataset
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$pct >= 0))
These assertions will help ensure the integrity of your dataset as you process it. Adjust any messages or conditions based on your specific needs!

You can add the following stopifnot checks to ensure that the end_date is not larger than Sys.Date() - 60 and that days_since_end is between 0 and 1:

r
Copy code
# Check that end_date is not larger than Sys.Date() - 60
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$end_date <= (Sys.Date() - 60)))

# Check that days_since_end is between 0 and 1
stopifnot(all(poll_cleaned$days_since_end >= 0 & poll_cleaned$days_since_end <= 1))
These checks will help confirm that the end_date is correctly filtered and that the days_since_end values fall within the expected range. If any of these conditions are not met, R will throw an error, indicating where the issue may lie.

for poll_harris_cleaned dataset, can you eliminate those state == 'National', group it by state, and for each state find the average harris_support_ratio
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
You can eliminate the rows where state is equal to 'National', group the dataset by state, and then calculate the average harris_support_ratio for each state using the following code:

r
Copy code
poll_harris_cleaned <- poll_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>         # Eliminate rows where state is 'National'
  group_by(state) |>                      # Group by state
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |>  # Calculate average
  ungroup()                               # Ungroup the data frame
In this code:

filter(state != 'National') removes rows with state equal to 'National'.
group_by(state) groups the remaining data by state.
summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) calculates the average harris_support_ratio for each state, using na.rm = TRUE to ignore any NA values.
ungroup() is used to return the dataset to its ungrouped state after the summary.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To fill the states not included in your poll_harris_cleaned dataset with grey, you can first create a complete map of all states and then join it with your average values. This way, states not included in poll_harris_cleaned will default to a grey fill.

Here's how you can do it:

Use a dataset of U.S. states with their geometries.
Join your summarized data with this dataset.
Adjust the fill aesthetic to handle missing values.
Here’s an example code snippet using maps and dplyr for the state map:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(ggstatebins)

# Load state map data
state_map <- map_data("state")

# Prepare the poll_harris_cleaned dataset
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup()

# Join the state map with the summary data
state_map <- state_map |>
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Create the plot
ggplot(state_map, aes(map_id = region)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = ifelse(is.na(average_harris_support_ratio), "grey", average_harris_support_ratio)), map = state_map) +
  expand_limits(x = state_map$long, y = state_map$lat) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Adjustments:
Joining the State Map: The left_join ensures all states are included in the plot, and missing values from poll_harris_cleaned_summary will default to NA.
Fill Handling: The ifelse(is.na(...), "grey", ...) function allows for grey fill in states without data.
Using na.value: The na.value = "grey" argument in scale_fill_gradient2 ensures that any missing average values will also be displayed in grey.
This code assumes you have the necessary libraries (ggplot2, dplyr, and maps) installed and loaded. Adjust the dataset join key if your state names are formatted differently.






You said:
can you modify the code I just sent you? This is a little bit complicated
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Sure! Let’s simplify the process while keeping your existing code structure. You can modify your original code to include grey for states not in the dataset like this:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Summarize the data by state, excluding 'National'
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ungroup()

# Create a full list of states to fill in grey for missing states
all_states <- data.frame(state = state.abb)  # Assuming you want to use state abbreviations

# Join the summary with all states to include missing states
state_summary <- all_states |> 
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = "state")

# Create the map plot
ggplot(state_summary, aes(map_id = state)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = ifelse(is.na(average_harris_support_ratio), "grey", average_harris_support_ratio)), map = state_map) +
  expand_limits(x = state_map$long, y = state_map$lat) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Changes:
Full List of States: Added a data frame all_states to include all state abbreviations. You might need to adjust it if your states are in a different format.
Left Join: The left_join with poll_harris_cleaned_summary ensures that all states are represented.
Fill Logic: The ifelse(is.na(...), "grey", ...) logic remains to fill states not in the dataset with grey.
This should work to display all states while highlighting those with data in the gradient specified, and grey for those without data.

It looks like you’re running into a couple of issues: a warning about non-finite values and an error indicating that state_map is not found. Let's address both of these.

1. Warning: Removed Rows
The warning message you see (Removed 1869 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range) suggests that there are NA or non-finite values in your average_harris_support_ratio column. To handle this, you can ensure you are using na.rm = TRUE in your calculations, which you have already included. If some states are not present in the poll_harris_cleaned dataset, they will have NA values, which is what you are intending to fill with grey.

2. Error: state_map Not Found
The error about state_map not being found indicates that the object state_map (which should contain the map data for the states) hasn’t been defined in your code. You will need to load or define this object before running the plotting code. A common way to get state boundaries is to use the maps package or the map_data() function from ggplot2. Here’s how you can do that:

Complete Example Code
Here's how to revise your code to ensure it works correctly:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)

# Summarize the data by state, excluding 'National'
poll_harris_cleaned_summary <- poll_harris_cleaned |>
  filter(state != 'National') |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(average_harris_support_ratio = mean(harris_support_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ungroup()

# Create a full list of states to fill in grey for missing states
all_states <- data.frame(state = state.abb)  # Assuming you want to use state abbreviations

# Join the summary with all states to include missing states
state_summary <- all_states |> 
  left_join(poll_harris_cleaned_summary, by = "state")

# Get state map data
state_map <- map_data("state")

# Create the map plot
ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data = state_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_polygon(data = state_summary, aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = average_harris_support_ratio), 
               color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#971116", high = "#005D94", mid = "white", midpoint = 0.5, na.value = "grey") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  labs(fill = "Proportion of Voters \nSupporting Harris")
Key Changes:
Loading Map Data: The state_map is obtained using map_data("state"). This gives the necessary coordinates for plotting the states.
Polygon Layers: Use geom_polygon() to plot both the state boundaries and the fill colors based on your calculated ratios.
Debugging Steps
If the warnings about removed rows persist, check the poll_harris_cleaned_summary to confirm that it contains the expected data.
If you encounter further issues, make sure that the poll_harris_cleaned dataset is correctly populated before summarizing.
This approach should resolve the errors you're facing and provide the desired visualization with missing states filled in grey.

what does statistic = "mad" mean
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
In statistics, MAD stands for Median Absolute Deviation. It is a robust measure of variability or dispersion, particularly useful when data contains outliers. Here's how it works:

Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) is calculated as the median of the absolute deviations from the data's median:
MAD
=
median
(
∣
X
i
−
median
(
X
)
∣
)
MAD=median(∣X 
i
​	
 −median(X)∣)
where 
X
i
X 
i
​	
  are the data points.
Using statistic = "mad" typically indicates that the MAD is being computed or plotted instead of the more common standard deviation. This is often preferred when the data is non-normally distributed or contains significant outliers, as MAD is less sensitive to extreme values than standard deviation.

The x-axis categorizes surveys as either national or state, while the y-axis represents the numeric grade assigned to each survey, ranging from 0 to 3 in 0.5 increments. The figure shows the distribution of numeric grades across the two categories, illustrating the central tendency and variability of grades for both national and state-level polls. This provides insight into whether survey quality differs depending on the scope of the survey (national vs. state).

Your code looks good for calculating the weighted average of Harris support by state. If you're looking for a title for the table or want any specific adjustments, let me know! Here's a suggestion for a title:

Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support by State






You said:
is it okay? Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support Based On National Survey
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
That title works well! It clearly indicates that the values represent the weighted average proportion of Harris support derived from national surveys. If you want to emphasize the dataset further, you might consider adding "in the Dataset" or "in the Analysis" at the end, but it's not necessary. Your original title is clear and informative!






You said:
is there any mistake in my title
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your title is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning. However, for clarity and flow, you might consider rephrasing it slightly. Here are a couple of options:

"Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support from National Surveys"
"Weighted Average Proportion of Harris Support Based on National Survey Data"
These alternatives maintain your original intent while enhancing readability. But your original title is still perfectly acceptable!






You said:
Proportion of Harris Support from State Surveys By State
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your title is clear, but it could be slightly refined for better flow. Here’s a revised suggestion:

"Proportion of Harris Support by State from State Surveys"

This wording emphasizes that the proportions are specific to each state and are derived from state surveys. If you prefer your version, it’s still understandable!

modelsummary(
  list("Support Harris" = harris_model),
  statistic = "mad"
  )
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Your code is almost correct for using the modelsummary package to summarize your model, but it's missing the function call for modelsummary(). Here’s how it should look:

r
Copy code
modelsummary(
  list("Support Harris" = harris_model),
  statistic = "mad"
)
Just ensure you have the modelsummary package installed and loaded in your R environment. This command will display a summary of your harris_model with the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as the statistic.






You said:
give it a title given that: harris_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = harris_support_ratio ~ pollster + numeric_grade + days_since_end + population,  # Include national_poll as a predictor
  data = poll_harris_cleaned,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 7
)

A suitable title for your model summary could be:

"Bayesian Model of Harris Support Ratio: Effects of Pollster, Numeric Grade, Days Since End, and Population"

This title captures the key aspects of the model and the predictors involved.






You said:
a title for the summary table
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Here’s a concise title for the summary table:

"Summary of Bayesian Model Results for Harris Support Ratio"

This title clearly indicates that the table presents the results from the Bayesian model related to Harris support.

ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
To rewrite your checks using the testthat package in R, you'll need to replace stopifnot with the appropriate test_that() structure. Here's how you can do it:

r
Copy code
library(testthat)
library(here)
library(arrow)

# Load the raw and cleaned datasets
poll_raw <- read.csv(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls.csv"))
poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
poll_harris_national_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data_with_prediction/national_prediction.parquet"))
poll_harris_state_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data_with_prediction/state_prediction.parquet"))

# Test that the sum of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count
test_that("Sum of rows in national and state cleaned data equals total rows in cleaned data", {
  expect_equal(nrow(poll_harris_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_harris_state_cleaned), nrow(poll_harris_cleaned))
})

# Test that the numeric grades of pollsters are no less than 2.0
test_that("Pollsters' numeric grades are no less than 2.0", {
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$numeric_grade >= 2.0))
})

# Test that harris_support_ratio is between 0 and 1
test_that("harris_support_ratio is numeric and between 0 and 1", {
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio >= 0 & poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio <= 1))
})

# Test that the cleaned dataset only contains rows for Trump and Harris
test_that("Dataset only contains Trump and Harris as candidates", {
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")))
})

# Test that there are no negative pct values and pct is within 0 to 100
test_that("pct values are between 0 and 100", {
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$pct))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$pct >= 0 & poll_cleaned$pct <= 100))
})

# Test that days_since_end is between 0 and 1
test_that("days_since_end is numeric and between 0 and 1", {
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$days_since_end))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$days_since_end >= 0 & poll_cleaned$days_since_end <= 1))
})

# Test that there are at most two unique values in state_or_national and at most 52 values in state
test_that("At most two unique values in state_or_national and 52 in state", {
  expect_lte(length(unique(poll_cleaned$state_or_national)), 2)
  expect_lte(length(unique(poll_cleaned$state)), 52)
})
Key Changes:
Replaced stopifnot with test_that() and expect_* functions.
expect_equal is used when testing for equality.
expect_true is used for conditions that should evaluate to TRUE.
expect_lte (less than or equal to) checks if the number of unique values is under a specified threshold.
This version is structured to integrate with the testthat package, which is common in R for unit testing.






You said:
instead of load the datasets at the beginning, can you add this in every test_that, something like test_that("Range Validation Test: Numerical columns are within expected ranges", {
  candidate_data <- read_csv(here("data", "02-analysis_data", "candidate_sup_num_data.csv"))
  print(names(candidate_data))  # Debugging: Print column names to verify
  # Assuming weight_value should be between 0 and 10000, ignoring NA values
  expect_true(all(candidate_data$weight_value[!is.na(candidate_data$weight_value)] >= 0 &
                    candidate_data$weight_value[!is.na(candidate_data$weight_value)] <= 10000),
              "Weight value is out of the expected range (0-10000).")
})?

Sure! Here's how you can integrate dataset loading within each test_that block, similar to your example, so that each test independently reads the dataset:

r
Copy code
library(testthat)
library(here)
library(arrow)

# Test that the sum of rows in the filtered datasets equals the original row count
test_that("Sum of rows in national and state cleaned data equals total rows in cleaned data", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  poll_harris_national_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data_with_prediction/national_prediction.parquet"))
  poll_harris_state_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data_with_prediction/state_prediction.parquet"))
  
  expect_equal(nrow(poll_harris_national_cleaned) + nrow(poll_harris_state_cleaned), nrow(poll_cleaned))
})

# Test that the numeric grades of pollsters are no less than 2.0
test_that("Pollsters' numeric grades are no less than 2.0", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$numeric_grade >= 2.0))
})

# Test that harris_support_ratio is between 0 and 1
test_that("harris_support_ratio is numeric and between 0 and 1", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio >= 0 & poll_cleaned$harris_support_ratio <= 1))
})

# Test that the cleaned dataset only contains rows for Trump and Harris
test_that("Dataset only contains Trump and Harris as candidates", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$candidate_name %in% c("Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris")))
})

# Test that there are no negative pct values and pct is within 0 to 100
test_that("pct values are between 0 and 100", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$pct))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$pct >= 0 & poll_cleaned$pct <= 100))
})

# Test that days_since_end is between 0 and 1
test_that("days_since_end is numeric and between 0 and 1", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_true(is.numeric(poll_cleaned$days_since_end))
  expect_true(all(poll_cleaned$days_since_end >= 0 & poll_cleaned$days_since_end <= 1))
})

# Test that there are at most two unique values in state_or_national and at most 52 values in state
test_that("At most two unique values in state_or_national and 52 in state", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_lte(length(unique(poll_cleaned$state_or_national)), 2)
  expect_lte(length(unique(poll_cleaned$state)), 52)
})
Explanation of Changes:
Each test_that block independently loads the required datasets, ensuring that the data is fresh for each test.
I removed the initial dataset loading, as you requested, and placed dataset loading inside each block.
The code prints debugging info as needed (like column names) for verification if necessary, though I omitted the print() since it's not in every test, but you can add it as needed for specific tests.

library(dplyr)

# Test that critical columns have no missing values
test_that("No missing values in critical columns", {
  poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  
  expect_false(any(is.na(poll_cleaned$poll_id)), "Missing values found in poll_id")

Explanation:
No missing values in critical columns: Checks for missing values in columns essential for your analysis (poll_id, pollster_id, numeric_grade, pct, sample_size, candidate_name).
Expected data types: Ensures that key columns have the expected data types (e.g., poll_id is a string, numeric_grade is numeric, start_date and end_date are dates).
state_or_national validation: Verifies that the state_or_national column only contains "State" or "National."
harris_support_ratio: Ensures that harris_support_ratio is always between 0 and 1.
This structure ensures that your data cleaning results are correctly validated.

  expect_false(any(is.na(simulated_cleaned$candidate_name)), "Missing values found in candidate_name")
})

# Test that certain columns have the expected data types in simulated data

  expect_true(all(simulated_state$state != "National"), "Some state polls are incorrectly categorized")
})
Explanation:
No missing values in critical columns: Checks that critical columns (poll_id, pollster, numeric_grade, pct, etc.) don't contain any missing values.
Expected data types: Ensures that columns have the expected data types (e.g., poll_id is an integer, pct is numeric).
numeric_grade validation: Confirms that numeric_grade is at least 2.0, as in your cleaning step.
pct range: Verifies that pct values are between 0 and 100.
days_since_end range: Checks that days_since_end is properly calculated between 0 and 1.
state_or_national categories: Ensures that the national and state datasets are correctly categorized based on the state column.
These tests will help validate the structure and content of your simulated dataset.

do I need to add something like poll_cleaned <- read_parquet(here("downloads/election_prediction/inputs/data/president_polls_cleaned.parquet"))
  but I did not write/save simulated data
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
Since your simulated data exists only in memory (i.e., you haven't saved it to a file), you don't need to load it using read_parquet or any similar function. Instead, you can directly reference the in-memory datasets (simulated_cleaned, simulated_national, simulated_state) in your test_that tests without any additional loading step.

The tests will work directly on the data you've already created in your R environment, so no need to add a file read operation for the simulated data unless you decide to save and reload it later.

Here's how you would use the in-memory data in the tests:

r
Copy code
# Since simulated data is in memory, no need to load from a file
test_that("No missing values in critical columns in simulated data", {
  expect_false

Key Tests:
State validation:
simulated_national should only contain "National" in the state column.
simulated_state should exclude "National" in the state column.
No missing values:
Ensure no missing values in critical columns (e.g., poll_id, pollster, numeric_grade, pct) for both datasets.
Range validation:
Confirm that pct values are within the expected range (0-100) in both datasets.
Validate that days_since_end is properly calculated and falls between 0 and 1.
These tests will help ensure that your simulated_national and simulated_state datasets are correctly filtered and structured.

  filter(sample_size <= 5000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = numeric_grade, y = harris_support_ratio, color = state_or_national)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +  # Reduce overplotting by adding transparency

  )
Changes made:
x label: Changed to "Pollster Numeric Grade" for clarity.
y label: Changed to "Harris Support Ratio" because that's what is being plotted, not the sample size.
color legend: Simplified to "Poll Type (State/National)" for clarity.
alpha: Added alpha = 0.5 to the geom_jitter() to help with visibility when there are too many points.
This should improve the plot's readability and make the labels more accurate and concise.

To change your plot into a histogram, similar to the example with the World Bank data, we can create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of harris_support_ratio based on state_or_national. Here's how you can modify your code:

r
Copy code
poll_cleaned |>

    y = "Number of Polls",        # Y-axis label for the number of occurrences
    fill = "Poll Type (State/National)",  # Legend label for state_or_national
    caption = "Data source: Simulated Poll Data."
  ) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")  # Using the same palette for fill colors
Modifications:
Changed to geom_histogram(): This will plot the distribution of harris_support_ratio.
bins parameter: Set to 30 to control the number of bins in the histogram.
Transparency (alpha = 0.5): Helps when the bars overlap.
Axis labels and legend: Updated to reflect the data being visualized.
scale_fill_brewer(): Maintained the color palette, changing it from scale_color_brewer() to scale_fill_brewer() to match the fill aesthetic.
This version will display the distribution of harris_support_ratio for state and national polls, similar to the World Bank example.

You can say that, but it could be clearer. Here’s a more refined version:

"Harris Support Ratio among Support for Harris and Trump"

This phrasing is more straightforward and accurately conveys that it refers to the ratio of support for Harris in relation to the combined support for both Harris and Trump. If you're looking for a more concise option, you might consider:

"Harris Support Ratio Relative to Trump"

The mode of support from state polls are a little bit less than 0.5, while the mode and majority of support from national polls are slightly larger than 0.5 
ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT
The analysis reveals notable differences between state and national polls. First, there are significantly more state polls than national polls, indicating a greater focus on regional variations in voter preferences. Additionally, state polls exhibit a wider range of support proportions, reflecting the diverse political landscape across different regions, whereas national polls tend to cluster more closely around a support ratio of 0.5. Interestingly, the mode of support for state polls is slightly below 0.5, suggesting that a substantial number of state polls show less than equal backing for the candidates. In contrast, national polls demonstrate a mode and majority support slightly above 0.5, highlighting a tendency for more balanced or favorable perceptions of the candidates at the national level. These findings underscore the distinct dynamics of state versus national polling and the varying levels of support for the candidates.

ChatGPT
Here’s how you can create a summary table for your original poll_harris_national_cleaned dataset that includes mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, and count of the weighted average Harris support, grouped by state. This will help provide a comprehensive overview of the data:

r
Copy code
# Create a summary table for the original dataset
summary_table <- poll_harris_national_cleaned |>
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarise(
    Weighted_Avg_Harris_Support = sum(harris_support_ratio * sample_size, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(sample_size, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    Weighted_Avg_Harris_Support = round(Weighted_Avg_Harris_Support, 3)

Correct my mistake and make the unclear writing clear only, do not improve my writing if it is already good: The upcoming 2024 United States presidential election, scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, will see U.S. citizens electing the country’s president and vice president for the next four years. The current vice president, Kamala Harris, is the candidate from the Democratic Party, while Donald Trump, the former president from the Republican Party, is running for re-election for a nonconsecutive term. The United States elects its president through the Electoral College. The number of electoral votes assigned to each state depends on its representation in the Senate and House of Representatives, meaning it is possible to win the popular vote yet lose the election. Despite the significance of electoral votes and the presence of multiple candidates, this paper will focus on the popular votes of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump due to the dominance of the Democratic and Republican parties in the current U.S. political system. The electoral votes will be calculated only for states with data due to the limited information available for each state.

In this paper, the estimand being explored is the popular vote for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. I will use a Bayesian generalized linear model to predict the outcomes, with the following predictors: pollster, numeric grade of the pollster, recency of the poll, and the population of the respondent groups. Using the poll-of-polls method, which aggregates several polls to forecast results aiming for greater accuracy, the predicted national popular vote for Harris only considering the two candidates is 50.9%, which is 1.8% higher than Trump’s support. This difference will be smaller when accounting for all candidates in the 2024 presidential election. Based on predicted state results, 16 out of 28 states show higher support for Harris, 9 states show higher support for Trump, while 3 states have 50% support for each. It is also found that Harris's supporters are concentrated in the West Coast and Northeast regions, whereas Trump's supporters tend to be in the central part of the U.S. Presidential election forecasts have always been important because they help understand U.S. citizens' priority issues and assist parties in shaping campaign strategies for better decision-making.

The data utilized for analysis is presented in @sec-data. Following that, @sec-model introduces the model created to forecast election outcomes. I will then explain the predicted results derived from the model in @sec-results. Lastly, @sec-discussions discusses the results in a broader context and address weaknesses of this paper as well as the future focus. This paper uses the programming language R [@r]. The analysis, the model and all the visualizations use the following packages: dplyr [@dplyr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], here [@here], janitor [@janitor], knitr [@knitr], readr [@readr], modelsummary [@modelsummary],  statebins [@statebins], arrow [@arrow], stringr [@stringr], tidyr [@tidyr], lubridate [@lubridate], rstanarm [@rstanarm], bayesplot [@bayesplot].

Different polls from various pollsters have different methods for conducting surveys that translate real-world phenomena into numerical data. However, the underlying logic is similar. Pollsters typically start by selecting a sample of the population that reflects the broader electorate; this could be a national survey, a state survey, or a target group. Based on the population sample and budget, the pollster will release the survey on a preferred platforms. For example, they might release the poll on social media if they want more general and diverse participants, or use news media to achieve a higher response rate. Good pollsters design questions that are clear and unbiased, often asking respondents to choose from a list of candidates or political parties. The survey usually includes additional questions, such as the age, gender, and education of the participants. Each response, representing a real-world decision, becomes an entry in a dataset that captures individual voting intentions.

The method used to forecast in this analysis is the poll-of-polls, which aggregates results from multiple polls instead of relying on a single survey. In this method, each poll is assigned a weight based on factors such as sample size, recency, and the pollster’s historical accuracy. Therefore, the larger the weight, the more reliable the polls are in the aggregation. While any single poll from the aggregated set could be used to forecast the presidential election results, this analysis use the aggregated poll to enhance the accuracy and stability of the predictions.

The weight provided by FiveThirtyEight, referred to as numeric_grade in the dataset, is based on the historical track record and methodological transparency of each polling firm’s polls [@538PollsterRatings]. Additionally, polls receive reduced weight if the pollster who conducted them has released a large number of surveys in a short period of time. The weight ranges from 0.5 to 3.0, with 3.0 being the most reliable pollster. The numeric grades of all the polls' pollsters are shown in @fig-raw_grade. The median numeric grade of all polls in the original dataset is 1.9, while the mean is approximately 2.17. A low numeric grade indicates low reliability, while filtering for only the highest grades leaves too few polls. To balance data quantity and reliability, I decided to include the top 40% of polls with a numeric grade of 2.5 or higher, excluding those with grades below 2.5. Examples of pollsters with a 3.0 grade include The New York Times/Siena College, ABC News/The Washington Post, and YouGov. Examples with a 2.5 grade are the Public Policy Institute of California, Pew Research Center, and the University of Illinois Springfield Survey Research Office [@538PollsterRatings].

At least 30 polls target Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas each have at least 10 surveys. The remaining states either have a single-digit number of surveys or none at all. Out of the 28 states, 11 show more support for Trump, while 16 have more support for Harris, with North Carolina having exactly equal support for both. In @tbl-state, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington all have more than 60% support for Harris, representing a 20% lead. South Dakota is the only state with less than 40% support for Harris, meaning Trump is leading by more than 20% here.

Your writing is mostly correct, but there are a few clarifications and adjustments needed for accuracy:

Correctness of the Model Description: The phrase "I employ a Bayesian regression model with a Normal distribution that incorporates multiple predictors" is appropriate, but you may want to specify that you are using the stan_glm function, which is designed for Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs). This highlights the use of the Gaussian family (Normal distribution) explicitly in your model.

Use of Other Packages: Based on your code, you are using the here package to manage file paths, and rstanarm for Bayesian modeling. If you are using dplyr (or another tidyverse package) for data manipulation, you might mention that as well.

Dependent Variable Description: Your dependent variable, harris_support_ratio, is correctly described as the proportion of respondents who support Kamala Harris. It is appropriate to assume it's continuous when the sample size is sufficiently large.

Here’s a revised version of your original sentence that incorporates these points:

"I employ the stan_glm function from the rstanarm package to create a Bayesian regression model with a Normal distribution that incorporates multiple predictors, using the programming language R [@r]. The dependent variable is the proportion of respondents who support Kamala Harris, which is assumed to be continuous when the sample size is sufficiently large."

This revision maintains clarity while adding the necessary specifics about your modeling approach.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In your code, when you're specifying the prior distribution for the coefficients (the prior and prior_intercept arguments), you should use the scale of the normal distribution as it is, which is the standard deviation.

Here's how to interpret your choices:

Using 2.5 as the Scale: If you specify normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5), this means that you are setting a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.5. This is correct if you intend to express your prior beliefs in terms of standard deviation.

Using 
2.
5
2
2.5 
2
 : If you use normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5^2), this would imply that you're specifying the variance (which is not the standard way to set up priors in this context).

In summary, you should continue to use 2.5 as the scale for your prior distributions. Your current code is correct, and the standard deviation of 2.5 represents the uncertainty around your prior belief about the coefficients.

So your original specification:

r
Copy code
prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)
is appropriate for your Bayesian regression model.

However, you should clarify that Days Since End is scaled between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates the most recent survey, and the interpretation of how this affects the model could be made more explicit.

Your original description is mostly clear and free of spelling errors. However, I found a couple of minor improvements you could make for better clarity and flow:

Phrase Consistency: You might want to consistently refer to "the proportion of respondents who support Harris" instead of "Harris support ratio" to avoid ambiguity.

Use of "showing": The phrase "Days Since End ranges from 0 to 1, showing how recent the survey ended" could be slightly rephrased for clarity. For example: "Days Since End ranges from 0 to 1, indicating how recent the survey ended..."

General Clarity: The sentence that begins with "Each of these coefficients follows..." could be more explicit by adding "prior distribution" at the end: "...with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 2.5 prior distribution."

correct my sentence: As mentioned in @sec-data_methodology_and_measurement, the dataset includes pollsters with partisan and internal campaign polls, so I selected Pollster as one of the factors, as different pollsters may attract respondents with varying voting preferences. The numeric grade is also included, as it reflects the historical accuracy and transparency of the pollsters. Since people’s voting preferences can change over time and become more stable as the election approaches, recency, represented by the number of days since the survey ended, is selected as a factor. Additionally, I also contain population because exploring the voting preferences of individuals who can and will vote is meaningful.

The model assumes that the priors, particularly the normal priors on the coefficients, are appropriate. One potential limitation is that the model may underperform for highly skewed data or when extreme outliers significantly influence poll results. The model also assumes Harris's support to be continuous, which may not be appropriate if the sample sizes are too small. A logistic distribution could be considered if the dependent variable is whether Harris or Trump will win the election, as it is useful for dealing with binary outcome variables.

The two parties typically maintain distinct yet steadfast stances, attracting a significant number of supporters and creating stable voting patterns in many states.

States on the West Coast and in the Northeast, which contain many large cities and urban areas, are generally wealthier than those in the central part of the country. The Republicans' and Trump's emphasis on economic improvement may explain why states in the Midwest lean Republican, as shown in @fig-state_prediction. This trend may also correlate with the rural and suburban demographics, where urban voters tend to support the Democratic Party while rural voters are more likely to favour Republicans [@pewresearchUrbanSuburban]. The Northeast contains many prestigious universities, including Ivy League institutions. From @fig-state_prediction, the strong support for Harris in the Northeast could be linked to the higher average education level in this region, as individuals with higher education levels tend to favour the Democratic Party [@yougov2024Presidential].

In addition to economic and educational factors, social and cultural values also shape voting patterns across states. Progressive states with the higher numbers of protests from January 2023 to August 2024 align with those that support Harris [@statistaUSRiots]. This is reasonable, given the Democratic Party’s prioritization of social justice and diversity. Conversely, regions with fewer protests tend to support Trump, where stability and tradition are more prevalent.

From @fig-summary, different pollsters may have their own preferences, attracting audiences with similar inclinations and leading to distinct polling results, even when the populations surveyed are the same. Some pollsters are known for their strong partisan alignment with the Democratic Party, while some favour the Republican Party. Therefore, I hope that these effects will counterbalance each other in this analysis, reducing potential bias. This again highlights the advantages of the poll-of-polls method: while individual polls may exhibit bias, a large collection of polls tends to produce more stable and reliable results.

Polling methodology can introduce sampling biases, as different data collection methods can lead to distinct distributions of demographic groups, ultimately affecting the representativeness of poll results. For instance, relying solely on online surveys may exclude individuals without internet access, while phone surveys might miss those who are at work and unwilling to participate during working hours.

@fig-methodology illustrates the polls conducted in Nebraska, grouped by methodology. Surveys collected through “live phone” or “live phone/text-to-web/email/mail-to-web/mail-to-phone” methods show around 55% support for Harris. In contrast, surveys using ‘IVR/Online Panel/Text-to-Web’ yield only 43.5% support for her. This significant difference in support rates underscores how data collection methods can inadvertently privilege certain voices while marginalizing others, thereby revealing underlying social inequalities. An accurate representation in polling is crucial for reflecting the diverse views of the electorate.

Some people who believe Trump will win talk about the idea of “shy Trump voters.” This theory suggests that some people don’t openly admit they’re voting for conservative candidates like Trump due to social pressure. This is similar to Britain’s “shy Tories” phenomenon, where polls tend to underestimate Conservative support. However, there isn’t much solid evidence to support the shy Trump voter theory, as many argue that a lot of Trump supporters are actually open and proud of their support [@nytimesOpinionNate].

Instead of "shy Trump voters", the real issue may be non-response bias. This happens when pollsters fail to reach certain voter groups, rather than people hiding their true intentions. In both 2016 and 2020, pollsters struggled to connect with enough Trump supporters, likely because Trump’s base often has lower civic engagement, making them less likely to participate in surveys [@nytimesOpinionNate].

Additionally, as a Black female candidate, Kamala Harris could face unique challenges. While the "Bradley effect", where voters may hesitate to admit they won’t vote for a Black candidate, didn’t affect Barack Obama in the past, Harris could still encounter similar obstacles. For example, in 2016, undecided voters leaned away from Hillary Clinton, which might signal a similar risk for Harris [@nytimesOpinionNate].

I eliminated all polls conducted by pollsters with a grade lower than 2.5, as this grade is assigned by FiveThirtyEight based on historical accuracy and methodological transparency. However, one potential weakness of the model is that I also included numeric grade as a predictor, which may duplicate its own effect on the model.

The dataset used for this analysis contains a poll that ended on August 25, which includes Joe Biden as one of the candidates, even though he announced his withdrawal in July. While unreliable polls like this were filtered out, the reliance on the original aggregated dataset may require further verification to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.

Another limitation is the aggregation of certain state-specific congressional districts with their respective states. For instance, Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (CD-2), which awards an electoral college vote independently, is grouped with the rest of Nebraska in the dataset. Though the proportion of Congressional District is small in the dataset, this may ignore unique voting patterns in regions like CD-2 that have distinct electoral significance. In the past six elections, Nebraska has consistently been a strong red state, typically showing about 60% support for Republicans and 40% for Democrats [@NebraskaPresidential]. However, @tbl-state indicates a 50.3% support for Harris in Nebraska, and @fig-methodology shows that surveys conducted using the “live phone” or “live phone/text-to-web/email/mail-to-web/mail-to-phone” methodologies indicate approximately 55% support for Harris. Similarly, North Carolina, which has traditionally been considered a safe red state, appears very neutral in both @fig-state and @fig-state_prediction. This raises questions about whether the polls are biased or if residents are genuinely changing their opinions this year.

The predictive model generated in this analysis, along with its strengths and limitations, serves as a foundation for ongoing discussions on campaign and policy strategies.

This year’s election is particularly unique due to Biden's withdrawal a few months before the election. For future study, I recommend that survey companies analyze how support for the two parties shifts in response to Biden’s announcement. This could help identify the number of voters who support the Democratic Party regardless of Biden's candidacy versus those who specifically supported him.

Furthermore, since the last election occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be beneficial for future research to examine the impacts of the pandemic on electoral behaviour. Comparing the results of the previous election with current trends will show how unforeseen events can alter political preferences among citizens.

YouGov’s surveys are conducted using online polling. The population is all the US citizens who can vote. Respondents are chosen based on a non-probability sampling, in which not everyone in the population has an equal chance of being selected, but the sample is adjusted using statistical weighting to better reflect the target population. To ensure representativeness, YouGov selects respondents who match the demographic characteristics of the population they are studying, including age, gender, race, education, and voting behaviour. The data will be then adjusted so that the survey results align with the actual distribution of these characteristics in the target population, meaning that if a survey has a higher or lower proportion of people from a certain demographic group than is present in the population, the results are weighted to correct for this imbalance. 

YouGov employs several verification and quality control steps. For instance, when new members join the panel, YouGov collects demographic information and verifies respondents’ email addresses and IP addresses. Additionally, YouGov monitors survey completion time and answer consistency to ensure the data is accurate. Panelists who provide unreliable data are either excluded from the final results or removed from the panel altogether.

To recruit a diverse panel, YouGov draws participants from many sources, including advertising and partnerships with other websites, and offers surveys in multiple languages. Although participation is limited to those with internet access, this still includes more than 95% of Americans. Respondents are also incentivized through a points system that can be exchanged for small rewards. When determining who to invite to participate in surveys, YouGov considers several factors, such as how recently a respondent has completed a survey, whether they prefer frequent participation, and their past response rates. For general population surveys, YouGov typically aims for sample sizes of 1,000 to 2,000 respondents to strike a balance between reliability and efficiency.
YouGov uses a multilevel regression with post-stratification model for vote estimation. Margin of error is calculated for each survey to indicate the range within which the true population value is expected to fall. To ensure data security and privacy, YouGov gives respondents control over their personal information. Respondents can request a copy of their data, or ask for corrections or deletions. When findings are reported, the data is aggregated to prevent the identification of individual respondents.

For the 2024 Presidential Election trackers on the YouGov website, the data comes from regular tracking surveys conducted by YouGov. The Question is “In November 2024, who would you vote for in the presidential election if these were the candidates?”, with question wording and response options varied over time [@yougov2024Presidential]. Respondents were selected using random sampling, stratified by gender, age, race, education, geographic region, and voter registration from the most recent American Community Survey. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status.

YouGov employs a well-structured methodology for conducting its surveys, allowing for rapid data collection and analysis. Although they use non-probability sampling, in which not everyone in the population has an equal chance of being selected, the sample is adjusted using statistical weighting to better reflect the target population. The fact that they recruit participants from many sources and implement several verification and quality control steps also makes the surveys reliable.

One of the primary strengths of YouGov’s methodology is its use of statistical weighting to adjust for demographic imbalances in the sample. By matching respondents to the target population based on key characteristics such as age, gender, race, education, and voting behavior, polls conducted by YouGov mitigate biases and are representative. Another strength is its focus on data accuracy and quality control. For example, monitoring the consistency of responses can enhance the reliability of the data collected.

A significant limitation is the aging census data used for weighting purposes. The use of the 2019 American Community Survey data for adjustments may not accurately reflect current demographic information. Utilizing more recent census data could enhance the accuracy of their weight adjustments.

The reliance on the 2019 American Community Survey data for adjustments may not accurately reflect current demographic information. Utilizing more recent census data could improve the accuracy of their weight adjustments.

If I had a budget of $100K to forecast the U.S. presidential election, I would conduct a survey with a sample size of 5,000 to 8,000 respondents, including 15 questions. I would aim to keep the survey between 5 and 10 minutes long, as shorter surveys tend to be more reliable and produce higher response and completion rates than longer surveys [@nihShortLong]. I would use stratified sampling to ensure that the sample reflects the U.S. population in terms of key demographics such as age, gender, race, education, and region, which would be asked in the survey. I would also include questions asking whom respondents voted for in the last election and which political party they lean toward. These questions would be used to adjust for demographic and political factors to better represent the population.

I would build the main body of respondents through an online opt-in panel. This online panel would be recruited using a mix of traditional advertising, partnerships with news websites such as The New York Times, and social media outreach to ensure diverse representation. I would allocate more of the budget to social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube because most people use these platforms, and the expected participation rate would be lower on social media compared to news media. Special attention would be paid to recruiting underrepresented groups, such as rural populations, non-college-educated voters, and minority communities. I would allocate $2,500 as five 500 dollars rewards to incentivize participants.

When participants sign up, they would undergo IP verification to avoid fraudulent responses. All participants would need to verify their identity via email activation. Since the time required to fill out the form is short and the rewards are relatively high, participants would likely not be annoyed by the email activation step. To ensure data quality, I would also implement methods such as time checks and answer checks. If participants complete the survey too quickly or provide answers that are all "prefer not to say" or "other," those responses will be discarded. This will help determine whether the data can be trusted. 

Simply asking, "Who did you vote for in the last election?" with one choice being "I did not vote" is insufficient, as assuming past voting behavior suggests that 2020 Biden and Trump voters will replicate the 2020 outcome by voting at the same rate in 2024 [@goodauthority]. Therefore, I include three additional questions regarding participants' attitudes toward voting to assess which respondents are likely to vote, and the data will be adjusted for likely voters. The survey link and questions can be found at the end of this section.

After receiving all the surveys, I would adjust the weights based on demographics using IPUMS 2024 U.S. Census data, political preferences based on previous election results, and the likelihood to vote to ensure that the sample is more representative. The I will then use a multilevel regression with post-stratification model to forecast the results.

Budget Allocation: 60K for recruitment and advertising; 5K for Incentives for respondents; 25K for data processing, weighting, and modelling; 10K for data security.

I used a pp_check, what can i infer from the graph
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To provide an accurate inference from your pp_check (posterior predictive check) graph, I would need to know the specific characteristics of the graph you generated and the context of your model. However, I can give you general insights into what you might infer from such a graph:

Fit of the Model: The primary purpose of a posterior predictive check is to assess how well your model fits the observed data. If the simulated predictions from your model closely match the actual observed data, it indicates that your model is doing a good job.

Distribution Comparison: Check whether the distribution of the observed data aligns with the distributions of the predicted data. If the observed data falls within the range of the predicted data and follows a similar shape, your model likely captures the underlying patterns well.

Outliers: Look for any significant discrepancies between the observed data and the predicted data. If there are many observed data points that lie outside the range of predicted values, it could indicate that your model is missing some important patterns or features in the data.

Parameter Estimates: If your graph shows uncertainty around predictions (e.g., via credible intervals), you can assess the robustness of your parameter estimates. Wider intervals may suggest more uncertainty, while narrower intervals may indicate more confidence in the predictions.

Model Improvements: If your pp_check indicates poor fit or discrepancies, it can guide you in improving your model, such as incorporating additional predictors, revising the model structure, or exploring different priors.

If you provide more details or specifics about the graph generated from your pp_check, I can give you a more tailored interpretation.
